This software is to run on:
  - The [**T**est **C**ell **C**ontroller (TCC)](https://github.com/Semi-ATE/TCC) if the DCS1K is build in to a handler.
  - The [Mini-SCT](https://github.com/Semi-ATE/MiniSCT) or [Maxi-SCT](https://github.com/Semi-ATE/MaxiSCT) if the DCS1K is not build in to a handler (and thus doesn't have a TCC)
